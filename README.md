# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Memory Card
This is a game where the player gets to selects two cards and flip over. If the two cards matches, they remain face up. If not, they are flipped face down again. 

The objective is to match all the pairs of cards with the least number of attempts. The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched.

## Environment Setup

### Creating React App using Vite
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a next-generation frontend build tool for web development. It was created by Evan You, the same developer behind the popular JavaScript framework Vue.js. The word "Vite" comes from the French word for "quick" or "fast," reflecting its primary focus on speed and efficiency.

### Create React App
Vite requires Node.js version 18+. 20+t App.
```
$ npm create vite@latest
```
`Then follow the prompts!` 
After running the _Vite_ command answers the following prompts on terminal:
1. Okay to proceed?(y) **y**
2. Project name: **your-project-name**
3. Select a framework: **React**
4. Select a variance: **Javascript**

Once thatâ€™s done run the following commands:

cd into your project folder
```
$ cd name-your-project
```
Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
To start the server
```
$ npm run dev
```
## Deployment
`Deployment setup.`

Open _vite.config.js_ add **base: "/repo-name/"**
```
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "/memory-card/"
})
```

Create a new .github folder inside the main directory. 
1. add a _workflows_ folder
2. add a file called _deploy.yml_ inside the _workflows_ folder and pasted in deployment setup code
